		In case you are curious, we are waiting for a transaction to occur in
		the Bitcoin network to the addresses <span id="ladd1">.</span> and <span
			id="radd1">.</span>. This will embed the document's digest in the
		blockchain permanently.
	</p>

<div class='hero-unit' id='confirmed_message' style="display: none;">
	<h3>Congratulations!</h3>
	<p>This document's digest was successfully embedded in the Bitcoin
		blockchain. It is now permanently certified and proven to exist since
		the transaction was confirmed.</p>
	<p id="tx"></p>
	<p>If you want to confirm the document's existence manually, follow
		this steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Calculate your document's SHA256 digest</li>
		<li>Open the transaction link above.</li>
		<li>The digest is embedded as the data payload of the two
			addresses receiving money in that transaction.</li>
		<li>The two addresses' Hash 160, when joined together, form the
			document's digest. Check them at <span id="ladd2">.</span> and <span
			id="radd2">.</span>.
		</li>
		<li>Alternatively you can check the Output Scripts of the
			transaction, which perpetuate the digest in the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
